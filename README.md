## Contents

### Machine Learning
- [Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection Analysis](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Portfolio/blob/main/Healthcare%20Provider%20Fraud%20Detection%20Analysis/Healthcare%20Provider%20Fraud.ipynb)
    - A model for predicting fraud or non-fraud on healthcare using various classification tools. Detect based on fraudulent behavior by providers so the insurance companies can reject or investigate claims using machine learning.
- [Safety Driving Detection using CNN](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Project-Code/blob/main/Safety%20Driving%20Detection/Safety%20Driving%20Detection.ipynb)
    - Predict safe or unsafe driving image classification
    
### Forecasting
- [Weekly Fuel Price Forecasting](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Portfolio/blob/main/Weekly%20Fuel%20Price%20Forecasting/Weekly%20Fuel%20Price%20Forecasting(MA%20LR)%20.ipynb)
    - Create a forecasting model to forecast weekly petrol and diesel prices using a combination of forecasting and regression methods. The fluctuations are often unpredictable, so this method can adjust for changes.
- [Netflix Stock Price Forecasting](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Portfolio/blob/main/Netflix%20Price%20Stock%20Forecasting/Netflix%20Price%20Stock%20Forecasting%20.ipynb)
    - Forecasting model to predict the Netflix closing stock price using the forecasting methods, with exogenous variables. This model focus to predict the daily closing price, it can help for daily trading.
- [Google Stock Price Forecasting LSTM](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Project-Code/blob/main/Google%20Stock%20Price%20Forecasting%20Using%20LSTM/Google%20Stock%20Price%20Forecasting%20.ipynb)
    - Forecast the Google stock price using LSTM model

### NLP
- [Yelp Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Portfolio/blob/main/Yelp%20Sentiment%20Analysis/Yelp%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)
    - Analyze and visualize sentiment from customer reviews on Yelp data. We can find out what businesses are popular and how customers respond to their experiences.
- [Text Emotion Classification using LSTM](https://github.com/BillyBSig/Data-Science--Project-Code/blob/main/Text%20Emotion%20Classification%20using%20LSTM/Text%20Emotion%20Classification.ipynb)
    - Predict emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise) from text using LSTM model
